        <p>
            My name is Llascer Simba, and I am originally from Mayotte, a beautiful island in the Indian Ocean. 
            I am currently a student at the IUT of Roanne, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Networks and Telecommunications. 
            My educational journey started at <strong>Collège Bouéni M'titi</strong> in Labattoir, where I built a strong academic foundation. 
            Later, I attended <strong>Lycée de Petite-Terre</strong>, where I specialized in Mathematics and Computer Science (NSI) and obtained my high school diploma in 2023.

                Since I discovered the world of IT, it has become a real passion. I enjoy exploring new technologies, whether it is web development, networks, or systems. Creating projects not only allows me to enhance my skills but also to tackle interesting technical challenges.
                For me, IT is a way to connect ideas and solve real-world problems.

            <p>
                Video games are one of my favorite hobbies. I love <strong>Overwatch</strong> for its complex strategies and the importance of teamwork. As a Kiriko main, I focus on supporting my teammates while making quick decisions to help achieve our objectives.

            <p>
                I also dedicate a lot of time to <strong>FIFA</strong>, a game where collaboration is essential. Whether I’m playing or managing a team in Career Mode, this game combines strategic thinking and competition, which I find particularly exciting.
            </p>
            <p>
                These games provide a rewarding experience by blending fun, strategy, and teamwork.

            <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Football</h2>
            <p>
                Football is more than just a sport for me; it is a true passion. I enjoy not only following major competitions like the Champions League but also playing on the field with my friends.
                As a fan of legendary teams like PSG, I am always excited to watch matches and discuss players' performances. Football has taught me discipline, teamwork, and the importance of never giving up—values that motivate me in other aspects of my life as well.
